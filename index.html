    <h2><marquee>Welcome to Fort Worth zoo!! </marquee></h2>
    <p>The Fort Worth Zoo is a zoo in Fort Worth, Texas, United States, and is home to 7,000 native and exotic animals. It has been named as a top zoo in the nation by Family Life magazine, the Los Angeles Times and USA Today, as well as one of the top zoos in the South by Southern Living Reader's Choice Awards.
    In the autumn of 2016, the zoo announced its $100-million capital campaign: A Wilder Vision, which will include new exhibit space, renovated habitats, special events space, multiple dining areas, restrooms and most importantly, new ways to observe, interact with and learn about animals. The first step in this plan, a renovated African Savanna, opened in April 2018. The second step in this plan, an expanded elephant exhibit, opened in April 2021. The other upcoming projects are renovated exhibits for the various African and Asian carnivores, and a new Forests & Jungles section. Species here include the clouded leopard, African wild dog, Malayan tiger, African Lion, cheetah, striped hyena, and African leopard for the African and Asian Predators section, this area opened in June of 2023. The okapi is the very first announced new species for the Forests & Jungles section, with a relocation of the Sumatran orangutans, jaguars, and the bongo. The planned opening date for the Forests & Jungles section is spring of 2025</p>
